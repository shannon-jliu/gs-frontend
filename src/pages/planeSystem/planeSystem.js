         * have to call it here. In fact, the function is made accessible by
         * mapDispatchToProps down at the bottom of the file. This starts to get more into
         * Redux specifics, and I can totally go more in depth if you want! Basically,
         * the function gets tied to this component's "props," which you can access through
         * this.props.THE_PROP_YOU_WANT. (Btw, a "component" is a React
         * term that basically means a chunk of HTML and Javascript code that usually
         * represent a page, or a button, or a checkbox, etc. React is a JavaScript library
         * that makes frontend development easier. One of its main ideas are components.
         * Components are nice because you can compartmentalize and then re-use code you made
         * for a specific UI element, much like how you would put a piece of regular code into
         * a function so that you could easily call that same piece of code in different places.
         * Another cool thing about React is that you can pass data between components. That's
         * actually what a "prop" is: Data passed into a component by a parent component. Redux
         * helps with these props and does some other fancy things to make data management in you
         * app a bit easier.)
