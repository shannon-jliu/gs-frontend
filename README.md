# ground-server-site

Welcome to the fully upgraded, WIP `ground-server` frontend. We are now using the latest version of ReactJS and Redux instead of NuclearJS.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `npm i` to install all the node modules. `gulp` to build the files is coming soon :( More to come!

## Development guide

This repo was created with `create-react-app` so `npm start` will run the dev server and will automatically watch changes. When creating a new branch, please use the format of `<your-username>/<informative-branch-name>`. Do not commit to master (you shouldn't be able to anyway) and only squash PRs (you also shouldn't be able to do anything else either).
